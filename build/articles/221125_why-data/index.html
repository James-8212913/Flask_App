    <h1>How Data can Improve Decision Making</h1>
<p>A well considered discussion is a skill. The reasons we form an opinion or in some cases change our perspective is generally as a product of a well considered argument. If we consider the evidence required to support a position on a matter, we should instinctively seek the highest quality evidence we can. This is where Data and the analysis of it can assist leaders in making better decisions. Data can form some of the best quality evidence which can then inform and support the ability to ultimately drive change. </p>
<h2>What are the elements of an Argument?</h2>
<p>The elements of an argument include a conclusion - the <em>thing</em> you are trying to convince people of. The main claim - the point that is the <em>because</em> behind the conclusion. The main claim is the thing that the evidence will have to support. This is the <em>reason</em> behind the main claim which will support your conclusion. Evidence or facts from the real world are critical elements of the process of building and argument and convincing others of something. Data and the analysis of it can play a critical role in providing the evidence to support a position on a matter. The art in this process is drawing conclusions to have the audience reason their way our position without too much effort. </p>
<p>If we consider the fact that leaders make decisions following the presentation of a position on a matter then the quality of the evidence that supports the conclusion is of paramount importance. </p>
<h2>Why does this matter - making a decision</h2>
<p>Evidentiary standards can assist with and inform the quality of our decisions. The higher the quality of our evidence, if considered carefully, the better our decisions should be. Evidence comes in many formats but two general classes - qualitative and quantitative. Qualitative evidence emphasises explanation and description where as quantitative evidence emphasises measurement and prediction. In our case when considering data these are two separate steps, the measurement of what has happened vs the prediction of what could happen. The graduate solution in this process is to get to a prescriptive step - prescribe a decision based on the current state and any changes that have occurred.  </p>
<p>The way we consider the elements of an organisation and understand how we can influence it based on the evidence that supports our argument is not just going to help leaders it will focus them on the right conclusion - the decision to be made and what making the decision will do. We can start to prescribe outcomes rather than simply point to the current state. This crucial step seeks to get beyond 'dash boards' and 'reports' but join the dots to offer a suite of options in the form of decisions to be taken and likely outcomes following the decisions themselves. </p>
<h2>What is considered good quality evidence?</h2>
<p>Two elements to the equation of quality evidence are usually apparent - the way the evidence is presented and the evidence itself. </p>
<h3>The presentation of evidence</h3>
<p>There are several instances of Data and the analysis of it being used poorly or in a misleading manner. This is usually seen in an ill-represented graph or visualisation. The science of our emotions can wreak havok on the facts when it comes to the presentation of Data. Care must be taken so that mis-repre </p>
<h3>The quality of the Data itself</h3>
<h2>What part does emotion play?</h2>
<p>How can we make better decisions, how do we drive change for the right reasons? These questions are particularly pertinent during times of uncertainty. The skill of argumentation and logic making will be ever more important as we consider the future. </p>
