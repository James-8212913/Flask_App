# Time Series 101

In this article we cover time series and some of the key concepts that underpin the analysis of time-series data. Things change over time, how much they change and how fast they change are of key concern for the majority of the population. Time is the single thing that we haven't figured out how to stop, and we can't get any more of it. It is a finite resource that is constant in its progression - regardless of what we do in the world time marches on. 

To consider the different elements of time series data we will look at the rainfall for Sydney, NSW Australia, Figure 1 is a simple time series plot of the rainfall over time.

As you can see there isn't any real pattern immediately on the top chart, when we group the rainfall by year and take the average we begin to see when the wet years were in Sydney.


## Characteristics of Time Series Data 

Time series Data has several characteristics. 

### Long Term Movements - Trend 

A trend is a general direction that something has been developing or changing, 

### Seasonal variations - Seasonality 


### Irregular or cyclic components
